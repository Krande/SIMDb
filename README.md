# SIMDb - Simulation Database

An attempt to host computational simulation data using EdgeDB.

The first priority will be to establish a data structure for 
simulation data from Finite Element analysis. 

Will also attempt to create a data structure for calculation results from 
structural engineering regulations such as Eurocode.
